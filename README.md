A game for reddit using:
- Reddit API
- Devvit
- Phaser
- Vite

This is my introduction to games on reddit and I am learning as I go. I am taking some influence from r/birbgame to help me figure it out.

Current challenges:
1 - Link the score to the API to implement a highscore shown on the Reddit block.
2 - Arrange the file ecosystem to be easier to maintain and read.
3 - Pretty up the game's UI.
