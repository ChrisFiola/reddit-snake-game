A game for reddit using:
- Reddit API
- Devvit
- Phaser
- Vite

Current challenges:
- Link the score to the API to implement a highscore shown on the Reddit block.
- Arrange the file ecosystem to be easier to maintain and read.
- Pretty up the game's UI.

This is my introduction to games on reddit and I am learning as I go. 
I am taking some influence from r/birbgame to help me figure it out.
